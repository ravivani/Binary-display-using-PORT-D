This circuit describes the eight LED to display binary of LED.

This circuit contains eight LED's containing two pins to the each LED.

Postive terminal of LED is a Anode , Negative terminal of LED is a cathode.

PORT-D contain eight (0-7) digital pins in arduino uno.

For binary display using eight LED's only PORT-D is used because eight pins are available only in PORT-D

Positive is connected to the digital pins of PORT-D , in between one resister is used to avoid the LED breaks ,it also control current flow.

Resistor formule is R = V/I,for LED min 220 ohms is used.

Negative is connected to the ground.

In this circuit leds should be connected in order of 0-7 in arduino.
